<!--  --><span><strong>Version 4.21.6</strong> is a regular update that improves operation of <strong>webcam uploads</strong> on <strong>iOS devices</strong>. It also contains a fix so that the plugin's admin <strong>Notifications</strong> are not shown in <strong>Comments</strong> Dashboard menu page.<br /><br />It is reminded that the previous version, 4.21.5, introduced a totally new design of the upload form, based on </span><a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Material UI</strong></a><span>. Material UI is a React implementation of Google's </span><a href="https://m3.material.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Material Design</strong></a><span> and the new elements of the plugin have been entirely created with the latest version of <strong>React</strong>.<br />To activate the new design open the </span><a href="https://www.iptanus.com/how-to-use-the-visual-editor-of-wordpress-file-upload-plugin/" target="_blank">visual editor</a><span> of the upload form, go to the new <strong>Themes</strong> tab and switch on <strong>Enable Material UI</strong>. In addition, the plugin provides options to define the basic Material UI <strong>colors</strong> and activate/deactivate <strong>dark mode</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Version 4.21.7</strong> was issued immediately after 4.21.6 to fix a bug with Notifications, crashing the website.<br /><br />
